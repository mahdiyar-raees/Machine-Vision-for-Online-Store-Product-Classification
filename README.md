# Machine Vision for Online Store Product Classification
## Project Overview

Welcome to the Machine Vision for Online Store Product Classification Project, a dynamic endeavor in machine learning and computer vision. This project focuses on classifying products from an online store into different classes using four distinct approaches: ResNet, Inception, MobileNet, and Semi-Supervised GAN.

**Key Highlights:**

- **Classification Approaches:** We have implemented four powerful machine learning approaches to tackle this classification problem, offering a comprehensive view of the field.

- **Product Categorization:** Our project clusters products into various classes, enhancing the organization and accessibility of products in an online store.

- **Diverse Approaches:** From the robust ResNet to the efficient MobileNet, our project showcases the versatility of machine vision techniques in solving real-world problems.
